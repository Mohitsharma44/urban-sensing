      "Robert Moses was a bringer of technology: the automobile and designed the city around that technology.  A big win for GM.  Now people are looking to digital technologies to design the new UTOPIAN City.  Instead of road networks there are digital networks.  Here comes IBM.  We can compute this and that which will reduce traffic and this and that.\n",
